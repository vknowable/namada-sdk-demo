# Namada Sdk Demo app

This demo app is an extension of the basic [Namada-sdk tutorial](project) which uses a combination of websockets, tendermint rpc, and Namada sdk queries to show some real-time info about the chain.  

To run the app:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be running on `http://localhost:4000` (change the port by editing `app/.env`).
